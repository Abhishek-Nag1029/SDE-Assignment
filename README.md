## Overview
The Contact Management System is a web-based solution for managing personal or business contacts. The app allows users to:

- Add new contacts with detailed information.
- View all contacts in a table with sorting and pagination features.
- Edit contact details to keep them updated.
- Delete contacts with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.

This system uses ReactJS for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete contacts.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Built with Material-UI (MUI) for an interactive and modern UI.
- **Sorting & Pagination**: Efficiently manage large contact lists.
- **Confirmation for Deletion**: Double confirmation before deleting a contact to prevent mistakes.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Material-UI (MUI), Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Other**: Git, GitHub for version control, Heroku (or another platform for deployment)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (for backend and frontend)
- MongoDB (for the database, or use a cloud version like MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name


2.Install backend dependencies:

cd contact-management-backend
npm install

3.Install FrontEnd dependencies:
cd ../contact-management-frontend
npm install


4.Configure the backend:

Update MongoDB connection details in server.js (or use a cloud-based database).
Set any necessary environment variables (such as API keys).

5.Run the backend:
cd ../contact-management-backend
node server.js

6.Run the frontend:

cd ../contact-management-frontend
npm start


Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

Add a New Contact: Fill out the contact form with details like name, email, phone, company, and job title.
View Contacts: All contacts will be displayed in a table. You can sort and paginate the list for better navigation.
Edit Contact: Click the edit button next to a contact to update their details.
Delete Contact: Click the delete button next to a contact and confirm the action to remove them.
API Endpoints
POST /contacts
Description: Adds a new contact.
Request Body:
json
.
{

  "company": "ABC Corp",
  "jobTitle": "Software Engineer"
}
GET /contacts
Description: Retrieves all contacts.
Response:
json
.

PUT /contacts/
Description: Updates a contact's information by ID.
Request Body: Similar to the POST /contacts request body.
Response: Updated contact information.
DELETE /contacts/

Database Schema
The database schema used for storing contact information is as follows:

json

{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "firstName": "String",
  "lastName": "String",
  "email": "String",
  "phone": "String",
  "company": "String",
  "jobTitle": "String",
  "createdAt": "Date",
  "updatedAt": "Date"
}
MongoDB Structure
The database schema used for storing contact information is as follows:

Collection Name: contacts
Fields:
_id: Unique identifier for each contact (automatically generated by MongoDB).
firstName: The first name of the contact.
lastName: The last name of the contact.
email: Email address of the contact.
phone: Phone number of the contact.
company: Company name associated with the contact.
jobTitle: Job title of the contact.
createdAt: Date the contact was created (automatically set).
updatedAt: Date the contact was last updated (automatically set).
Challenges Faced and Solutions
During the development of the Contact Management System, several challenges arose, and I tackled them using a systematic approach. Below are some key challenges and their resolutions:

Managing State Efficiently in React

Challenge: One of the key difficulties I faced was managing the state efficiently, especially when it came to handling complex operations like sorting, pagination, and CRUD operations. As the contact list grew, the performance of rendering and updating the UI became a concern.
Solution: I implemented React’s useState and useEffect hooks carefully to control the component re-renders. I also optimized the state updates by using state batching and minimizing unnecessary re-renders with memoization (React.memo) for components that did not require frequent updates.
Handling Asynchronous Operations with Axios

Challenge: Integrating Axios for HTTP requests to interact with the backend was tricky, especially with handling asynchronous operations such as creating, editing, and deleting contacts. Ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend without causing any race conditions or blocking UI updates was a challenge.
Solution: I made use of async/await in the frontend to handle asynchronous operations in a cleaner manner. Additionally, I implemented proper error handling and loading states to keep users informed about ongoing requests, improving the user experience.
Database Connectivity and MongoDB Schema

Challenge: Initially, connecting the backend to MongoDB caused issues, particularly in configuring MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting. The MongoDB connection string was not set up correctly, and database operations were not being executed as expected.
Solution: I carefully reviewed the connection setup in server.js and ensured the connection string was correct. I also added environment variables for better security and flexibility, such as using .env files for storing sensitive data like API keys and the MongoDB URI.
API Security and Validation

Challenge: Ensuring that the API was secure and that user inputs were validated correctly was another challenge. The application had to handle potential malicious inputs, especially during the creation and update of contacts.
Solution: I added validation layers using Mongoose schema validation to ensure that all fields (e.g., email format, phone number) followed the correct format. Additionally, I implemented basic authentication and authorization strategies to protect certain endpoints, although this system could be further enhanced by adding JWT-based authentication for a more secure user experience.
UI/UX Design and Responsiveness

Challenge: Creating a responsive UI that works well on both mobile and desktop devices was initially challenging, especially with the Material-UI components not rendering as expected in some cases.
Solution: I used Material-UI’s built-in Grid and Box components to build a flexible and responsive layout. I also made use of media queries to handle different screen sizes, ensuring the design remained consistent across devices.
Handling Large Contact Lists with Pagination and Sorting

Challenge: As the contact list grew, performance issues arose when trying to display all contacts at once. Sorting and pagination were crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience, but the sheer volume of data could lead to performance bottlenecks.
Solution: I implemented pagination and sorting features on both the backend and frontend. On the backend, I limited the number of contacts returned per request using MongoDB’s limit and skip functions. On the frontend, I used React’s useMemo and useCallback hooks to memoize sorted lists, preventing unnecessary recalculations during renders.
By tackling these challenges systematically and utilizing the right tools, I was able to resolve most issues and create a functional, responsive, and performant Contact Management System. The project helped me enhance my skills in full-stack development, particularly in handling asynchronous operations, managing state in React, optimizing
